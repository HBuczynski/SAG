Existing agents:
- Maze generator is used to generate random maze and change position of some defined number of walls during execution;
- Maze drawing agent refreshes view of the maze;
- Ant agent is used to simulate ant looking for shortest path and generating feromone during it's travel
- Ant colony agent holds information about existing feromones in maze and it's power

General assumptions:
- 


Parameters used:
- ants count
- moving walls count
- labyrinth size
- labyrinth density
